                Education for All is a global organization that aims to give every child the education 
                they deserve. We provide global and regional leadership in education, strengthen 
                education systems worldwide, and respond to contemporary global challenges through 
                education with gender equality as an underlying principle.

            <p>
                We believe that every child deserves to learn more about the world around them in a safe and 
                engaging environment that molds them to be responsible future members of society. We hope to 
                decrease social problems such as poverty and crime by thoroughly taking care of and providing 
                opportunities to our future generation. Our organization aims to provide quality education 
                for all because of our belief that a brighter tomorrow starts with education for all.
